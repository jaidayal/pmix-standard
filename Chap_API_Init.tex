\chapter{Initialization and Finalization}
\label{chap:api_init}

The \ac{PMIx} library is required to be initialized and finalized around the usage of most of the \acp{API}.
The \acp{API} that may be used outside of the initialized and finalized region are noted.
All other \acp{API} must be used inside this region.

There are three sets of initialization and finalization functions depending upon the role of the process in the \ac{PMIx} universe.
Each of these functional sets are described in this chapter.
Note that a process can only call \textit{one} of the init/finalize functional pairs - e.g., a process that calls the client initialization function cannot also call the tool or server initialization functions, and must call the corresponding client finalize.

\adviceuserstart
Processes that initialize as a server or tool automatically are given access to all client \acp{API}.
Server initialization includes setting up the infrastructure to support local clients - thus, it necessarily includes overhead and an increased memory footprint.
Tool initialization automatically searches for a server to which it can connect --- if declared as a \textit{launcher}, the \ac{PMIx} library sets up the required ``hooks'' for other tools (e.g., debuggers) to attach to it.

The following attributes are optional for implementers of \ac{PMIx} libraries:

%%%%
\descr

Initialize the \ac{PMIx} client, returning the process identifier assigned to this client's application in the provided \refstruct{pmix_proc_t} struct.
Passing a value of \code{NULL} for this parameter is allowed if the user wishes solely to initialize the \ac{PMIx} system and does not require return of the identifier at that time.

When called, the \ac{PMIx} client shall check for the required connection information of the local \ac{PMIx} server and establish the connection.
If the information is not found, or the server connection fails, then an appropriate error constant shall be returned.

If successful, the function shall return \refconst{PMIX_SUCCESS} and fill the \refarg{proc} structure (if provided) with the server-assigned namespace and rank of the process within the application.
In addition, all startup information provided by the resource manager shall be made available to the client process via subsequent calls to \refapi{PMIx_Get}.

The \ac{PMIx} client library shall be reference counted, and so multiple calls to \refapi{PMIx_Init} are allowed by the standard.
Thus, one way for an application process to obtain its namespace and rank is to simply call \refapi{PMIx_Init} with a non-NULL \refarg{proc} parameter.
Note that each call to \refapi{PMIx_Init} must be balanced with a call to \refapi{PMIx_Finalize} to maintain the reference count.

Each call to \refapi{PMIx_Init} may contain an array of \refstruct{pmix_info_t} structures passing directives to the \ac{PMIx} client library as per the above attributes.

Multiple calls to \refapi{PMIx_Init} shall not include conflicting directives.
The \refapi{PMIx_Init} function will return an error when directives that conflict with prior directives are encountered.

%%%%
\descr

Initialize the \ac{PMIx} tool, returning the process identifier assigned to this tool in the provided \refstruct{pmix_proc_t} struct. The \refarg{info} array is used to pass user requests pertaining to the init and subsequent operations. Passing a \code{NULL} value for the array pointer is supported if no directives are desired.

If called with the \refattr{PMIX_TOOL_DO_NOT_CONNECT} attribute, the \ac{PMIx} tool library will fully initialize but not attempt to connect to a \ac{PMIx} server. The tool can connect to a server at a later point in time, if desired. In all other cases, the \ac{PMIx} tool library will attempt to connect to according to the following precedence chain:

\begin{itemize}
    \item if \refattr{PMIX_SERVER_URI} or \refattr{PMIX_TCP_URI} is given, then connection will be attempted to the server at the specified \ac{URI}. Note that it is an error for both of these attributes to be specified. \refattr{PMIX_SERVER_URI} is the preferred method as it is more generalized --- \refattr{PMIX_TCP_URI} is provided for those cases where the user specifically wants to use a TCP transport for the connection and wants to error out if it isn't available or cannot succeed. The \ac{PMIx} library will return an error if connection fails --- it will not proceed to check for other connection options as the user specified a particular one to use
    \item if \refattr{PMIX_SERVER_PIDINFO} was provided, then the tool will search under the directory provided by the PMIX\_SERVER\_TMPDIR environmental variable for a rendezvous file created by the process corresponding to that \ac{PID}. The \ac{PMIx} library will return an error if the rendezvous file cannot be found, or the connection is refused by the server
    \item if \refattr{PMIX_CONNECT_TO_SYSTEM} is given, then the tool will search for a system-level rendezvous file created by a \ac{PMIx} server in the directory specified by the PMIX\_SYSTEM\_TMPDIR environmental variable. If found, then the tool will attempt to connect to it. An error is returned if the rendezvous file cannot be found or the connection is refused.
    \item if \refattr{PMIX_CONNECT_SYSTEM_FIRST} is given, then the tool will search for a system-level rendezvous file created by a \ac{PMIx} server in the directory specified by the PMIX\_SYSTEM\_TMPDIR environmental variable. If found, then the tool will attempt to connect to it. In this case, no error will be returned if the rendezvous file is not found or connection is refused --- the \ac{PMIx} library will silently continue to the next option
    \item by default, the tool will search the directory tree under the directory provided by the PMIX\_SERVER\_TMPDIR environmental variable for rendezvous files of \ac{PMIx} servers, attempting to connect to each it finds until one accepts the connection. If no rendezvous files are found, or all contacted servers refuse connection, then the \ac{PMIx} library will return an error.
\end{itemize}

If successful, the function will return \refconst{PMIX_SUCCESS} and will fill the provided structure (if provided) with the server-assigned namespace and rank of the tool. Note that each connection attempt in the above precedence chain will retry (with delay between each retry) a number of times according to the values of the corresponding attributes. Default is no retries.

Note that the \ac{PMIx} tool library is referenced counted, and so multiple calls to \refapi{PMIx_tool_init} are allowed.
Thus, one way to obtain the namespace and rank of the process is to simply call \refapi{PMIx_tool_init} with a non-NULL parameter.

Closes the connection, if existing, to a server and establishes a connection to the specified server. This function can be called at any time by a \ac{PMIx} tool to shift connections between servers.
The process identifier assigned to this tool is returned in the provided \refstruct{pmix_proc_t} struct. Passing a value of \code{NULL} for this parameter is allowed if the user wishes solely to connect to the \ac{PMIx} server and does not require return of the identifier at that time.

\adviceimplstart
\ac{PMIx} tools and clients are prohibited from being connected to more than one server at a time to avoid confusion in subsystems such as event notification.

When a tool connects to a server that is under a different namespace manager (e.g., host \ac{RM}) as the prior server, the identifier of the tool must remain unique in the namespaces. This may require the identifier of the tool to be changed on-the-fly, that is, the \refarg{proc} parameter would be filled (if non-NULL) with a different nspace/rank from the current tool identifier.
\adviceimplend

\adviceuserstart
Passing a \code{NULL} value for the \refarg{info} pointer is not allowed and will result in returning an error.

Some \ac{PMIx} implementations (for example, the current \ac{PRI}) may not support connecting to a server that is not under the same namespace manager (e.g., host \ac{RM}) as the tool.
